File sharing service
====================

File Sharing is a simple anonymous file sharing service where users can upload any number of files and the service will automatically generate a password protected ZIP file from the content. After uploading the file, the app will give you a password and a link for the file that you can pass on to the person in need. If youâ€™re looking for a good self-hosted solution for sharing files, you might want to try this out!
